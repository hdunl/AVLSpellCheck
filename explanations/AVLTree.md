# AVLTree Class - Comprehensive Explanation

## Introduction

The `AVLTree` class is an implementation of the AVL Tree data structure in Java. AVL Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree known for maintaining their balance after insertions and deletions. This comprehensive explanation provides insight into the various components and operations within this class.

## Class Structure

### Node Class

The `Node` class is a nested class within `AVLTree` that represents a node in the AVL Tree. It contains the following attributes:

- `data`: Stores the data (of type `T`) held by the node.
- `left`: Reference to the left child node.
- `right`: Reference to the right child node.
- `height`: Keeps track of the height of the node.

### Instance Variables

- `root`: A reference to the root node of the AVL Tree.

## Tree Height and Balance Factor

### Height Calculation

- The `height(Node node)` method calculates the height of a given node. If the node is `null`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the `height` attribute of the node.

### Balance Factor

- The `balanceFactor(Node node)` method computes the balance factor for a given node. The balance factor is defined as the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees.

## Rotations for Balancing

### Right Rotation (`rotateRight(Node y)`)

- This method performs a right rotation on a given node `y`. It restructures the tree to maintain balance and returns the new root of the subtree after rotation.

### Left Rotation (`rotateLeft(Node x)`)

- This method performs a left rotation on a given node `x`. Similar to the right rotation, it ensures the tree's balance and returns the new root of the subtree after rotation.

## Balancing the Tree

### Balancing Method (`balance(Node node)`)

- The `balance` method checks and balances a node to maintain the AVL property. If the balance factor of the node indicates imbalance, it performs the necessary rotations (single or double) to restore balance.

## Insertion Operation

### Insertion Method (`insert(T data)`)

- The `insert` method allows for the insertion of a new element (`data`) into the AVL Tree. It maintains the tree's structure and balance properties.

- A recursive helper method, `insert(Node node, T data)`, facilitates the insertion process by traversing the tree.

## Search Operation

### Search Method (`search(T data)`)

- The `search` method enables the search for a specific element (`data`) within the AVL Tree. It returns `true` if the element is found and `false` if it is not.

- A recursive helper method, `search(Node node, T data)`, is utilized to traverse the tree during the search operation.

## Conclusion

The `AVLTree` class offers a comprehensive implementation of an AVL Tree data structure. It manages tree balance through rotations and provides methods for inserting and searching elements, ensuring efficient and balanced data storage.

## Type Constraint

- The class is defined with a type parameter `T` that must be `Comparable`. This ensures that elements stored in the tree can be compared to maintain order.
