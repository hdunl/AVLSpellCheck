## StringSimilarityAlgorithm Interface

The `StringSimilarityAlgorithm` is an interface in Java that defines a contract for classes responsible for calculating the similarity between two strings. It provides a common structure for different algorithms to compute the similarity between strings.

### Methods

1. `calculateSimilarity(String s1, String s2)`: This method takes two input strings, `s1` and `s2`, and calculates a similarity score between them. The similarity score typically represents how similar or close the two strings are in terms of their content. The higher the similarity score, the more similar the strings are considered to be. Different algorithms can implement this method in various ways, such as using edit distance, cosine similarity, Jaccard index, or other similarity metrics.

2. `setMaxDistance(int maxDistance)`: This method allows you to set a maximum distance or threshold for considering strings as similar. It can be useful when you want to filter out strings that are too dissimilar to each other. For example, if `maxDistance` is set to 2, the algorithm may only consider strings as similar if their similarity score is below this threshold.

By defining this interface, you can create multiple classes that implement the `StringSimilarityAlgorithm` interface with different similarity calculation algorithms. This provides flexibility in choosing the appropriate algorithm based on your specific use case, such as spell checking, autocomplete, or similarity-based search. Each implementation of the interface would provide its own logic for calculating string similarity while adhering to the defined method signatures.
